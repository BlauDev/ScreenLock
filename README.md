# BlauLock

Type [`pastebin run d2pDApGK`](http://pastebin.com/d2pDApGK) to run the installer. If you want to use a third-party Operating System, install it first and then BlauLock (from CraftOS, if possible). You should be able to install another OS after BlauLock, but is not the recommended way.

This program is compatible with both advanced and non-advanced computers.
