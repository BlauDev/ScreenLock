## Installation
#### In CraftOS 1.x
If you only use the default Operating System (CraftOS), simply run the installer with this command: `pastebin run DN9BU7KN`

#### In any other OS
If you are using (or want to use) another OS, this program should be compatible with it, but you need to install it BEFORE install ScreenLock. After install it, switch to CraftOS (or open your OS shell) and type the same command above.
